### Iâ€™m the placeholder for your code so strong it rules all features.
**Remember:** Whenever you need to communicate between features, never do it directly. Avoid creating strong dependencies. Features should be independent of each other.  

If a feature requires to depend on another, use appropriate contracts here to keep the dependency lightweight.  

And if you find many dependencies between two particular features, ask yourself whether they should actually be merged into a single feature instead.
